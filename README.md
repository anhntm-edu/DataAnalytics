# Week 1: Introduction to DA
Data Analytics vs. Data Analysis
The terms Data Analysis and  Data Analytics are often used interchangeably, including in this course. 

However it is important to note that there is a subtle difference between the terms and meaning of the words Analysis and Analytics.  In fact some people go far as saying that these terms mean different things and should not be used interchangeably. Yes, there is a technical difference...

The dictionary meanings are:

Analysis - detailed examination of the elements or structure of something

Analytics - the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics

Analysis can be done without numbers or data, such as business analysis psycho analysis, etc. Whereas Analytics, even when used without the prefix "Data", almost invariably implies use of data for perfoming numerical manipulation and inference. 

Some experts even say that Data Analysis is based on inferences based on historical data whereas Data Analytics is for predicting future performance. The design team of this course does not subscribe to this view, and you will see why later in the course as you become familiar with the terms like predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, etc. 

So in this course we take a more liberal view, and use the terms Data Analysis and Data Analytics to mean the same thing. For example, an earlier video is titled Defining Data Analysis, whereas the preceeding video with the viewpoints of several data professionals is titled What is Data Analytics. The difference in these titles is not intentional.

# WEEK 2: 
## The Data Ecosystem and Languages for Data Professionals 
A data analyst ecosystem includes the infrastructure, software, tools, frameworks, and processes used to gather, clean, analyze, mine, and visualize data.  

Based on how well-defined the structure of the data is, data can be categorized as:

Structured Data, that is data which is well organized in formats that can be stored in databases.
Semi-Structured Data, that is data which is partially organized and partially free form.
Unstructured Data, that is data which can not be organized conventionally into rows and columns.
Data comes in a wide-ranging variety of file formats, such as delimited text files, spreadsheets, XML, PDF, and JSON, each with its own list of benefits and limitations of use.  

Data is extracted from multiple data sources, ranging from relational and non-relational databases to APIs, web services, data streams, social platforms, and sensor devices. 

Once the data is identified and gathered from different sources, it needs to be staged in a data repository so that it can be prepared for analysis. The type, format, and sources of data influence the type of data repository that can be used. 

Data professionals need a host of languages that can help them extract, prepare, and analyze data. These can be classified as:  

Querying languages, such as SQL, used for accessing and manipulating data from databases. 
Programming languages such as Python, R, and Java, for developing applications and controlling application behavior.
Shell and Scripting languages, such as Unix/Linux Shell, and PowerShell, for automating repetitive operational tasks.
